## Introduction

The Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable computer that has gained popularity for various projects. This repository provides documentation to help you install Raspberry Pi OS and understand system calls, which are essential for interacting with the operating system.

## Installation Guide

### Requirements

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- A Raspberry Pi (any model)
- A microSD card (at least 8GB)
- A computer with internet access
- A card reader (if your computer does not have one)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Download Raspberry Pi Imager**: Visit the [official Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) and download the Raspberry Pi Imager for your operating system.

2. **Prepare the microSD Card**:
   - Insert the microSD card into your card reader.
   - Open the Raspberry Pi Imager.
   - Select the OS you want to install. For beginners, choose "Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)".
   - Select your microSD card.
   - Click "Write" to start the installation process.

3. **Insert the microSD Card into the Raspberry Pi**: Once the writing process is complete, safely eject the microSD card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.

4. **Power Up the Raspberry Pi**: Connect the power supply to your Raspberry Pi. The system will boot up, and you should see the Raspberry Pi logo.

5. **Complete the Setup**: Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your Raspberry Pi. This includes configuring your language, time zone, and Wi-Fi settings.

6. **Update the System**: Once the setup is complete, open the terminal and run the following commands to update your system:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Raspberry Pi OS.

## System Calls Overview

### What are System Calls?

System calls are the primary way for programs to interact with the operating system. They provide a controlled interface for accessing hardware and system resources. Common system calls include file operations, process management, and network communication.

### Common System Calls

1. **open()**: Opens a file.
2. **read()**: Reads data from a file.
3. **write()**: Writes data to a file.
4. **close()**: Closes a file.
5. **fork()**: Creates a new process.
6. **exec()**: Executes a new program.

Understanding these calls is crucial for programming on the Raspberry Pi.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic System Call

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using the `open()` and `close()` system calls in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, 0644);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }
    // Write to the file
    write(fd, "Hello, Raspberry Pi!\n", 22);
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

This program creates a file named `example.txt` and writes a message to it.

### Example 2: File Operations

In this example, we will read from the file we created in the previous example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[100];
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }
    read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    printf("File content: %s", buffer);
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

This program opens `example.txt`, reads its content, and prints it to the console.
